#About Me
Name: Sonia Jackson
Hometown: Atlanta, Georgia, USA
Prior IT Experience: For seven years, I was an IBM 3341 Mainframe Computer Operator at the headquarters of an international organization. I have strong analytical skills and attention to detail.
Career Goals: My career goal is to change my career from insurance sales to a more exciting and challenging IT career. I want to complete the CyberSecurity Bootcamp equipped with the skills to become a GRC Analyst. Compliance adherence and implementation of procedures, integrity, coupled with an excellent work ethic, are the cornerstones of my professional career.
Proud Project/Task: As a manager, it was my responsibility to ensure that my staff remained current with cyber threat courses to prevent phishing scams and to safeguard company data. The company was most vulnerable when we transitioned all staff from the office to work from home. I worked closely with the IT department to ensure proper setup of company equipment.
